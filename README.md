# Game Server and Infrastructure Setup

This project is an attempt at fully automating steam headless servers.

It was initially designed to run a dedicated Barotrauma game server on Google Cloud Platform.

Tech tl;dr is basically: Terraform and Bash.

---

## 🧰 Requirements
- Terraform
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`)
- A valid GCP project (e.g., `europan-world`)
- GitHub account (for deploy keys)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Configure GitHub SSH access (once)**
    - See [`docs/setup/github-deploy-key.md`](./docs/setup/github-deploy-key.md)
    - This ensures your VM can clone private repos

2. **Configure & install GCP tooling** (once)
    - See [`docs/setup/gcp-service-account.md`](./docs/setup/gcp-service-account.md)
    - Then apply Terraform in the `/terraform` folder

3. **Terraform Basics**
    - See [`docs/setup/terraform.md`](./docs/setup/gcp-service-account.md)
    - Basic Terraform usage

4. **Debug server**
    - See [`docs/usage/troubleshooting.md`](./docs/usage/troubleshooting.md)
    - Some basic commands you can run to debug install and game server issues.

5. **Barotrauma Submarine Development**
    - See [`docs/setup/barotrauma.md`](./docs/setup/gcp-service-account.md)
    - Helpful when building submarines.
