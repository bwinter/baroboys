# Project Backlog (of sorts)

- Clean up IAM files and workflow (Fix / Upgrade)
- Get emails into secrets (Security)
- Get save data and game data into S3 / mount. (Security-ish & Reduce Git complexity.)
- Get tf state into S3 (Simplification & multi-admin device support.)
- Is there a better scripts folder layout? (I have already re-designed this once.)
- Improve the admin page (Make it handle multiple games and add the ability to start game. Later requires a bigger redesign.)
- Improve game selection (Currently a bit clunky, needing to edit the terraform files directly.)
