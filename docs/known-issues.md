## Open — Under Investigation

### VRising build failing: wineboot crashes with `could not load kernel32.dll`

**Symptoms:**
```
start_rpcss Failed to open RpcSs service
run_wineboot boot event wait timed out
wine: could not load kernel32.dll, status c0000135
```

**Root cause (working theory):** Commit `82d841c` added `export DISPLAY=:0` before the
`wineboot` call in `scripts/dependencies/wine/src/setup.sh`. Before that commit, wineboot
ran headless (no DISPLAY set) and succeeded. After, it fails with the above.

Two fixes have been attempted:
1. ✅ `xvfb-startup.service` `ExecStartPost=` socket check (issue #16) — fixed the Xvfb
   readiness race, but wineboot **still fails** with the same errors even when Xvfb is ready.
   This means the race condition was not the root cause of the wineboot failure.
2. ⏳ **Next to try:** remove `DISPLAY=:0` from before wineboot in `setup.sh` — let wineboot
   run headless as it did before `82d841c`. Keep `DISPLAY=:0` only for winetricks (which
   genuinely needs X for font installation). Build `boadh2537` is testing the socket check;
   if it still fails, apply this fix.

**Not the cause:** missing packages — `wine-stable-amd64` and `wine-stable-i386` both install fine.

## Open — Easy Fix

### VRising world name "TestWorld-1" hardcoded in multiple places

**Files:**
- `scripts/services/vrising/shutdown.sh:7` — `SAVE_DIR="VRising/Data/Saves/v4/TestWorld-1"`
- `scripts/services/vrising/src/refresh.sh:8` — `SAVE_DIR="$VRISING_DIR/Data/Saves/v4/TestWorld-1"`
- `VRising/VRisingServer_Data/StreamingAssets/Settings/ServerHostSettings.json` — `"SaveName": "TestWorld-1"`

**Effort:** Easy (extract to a shared variable or env var)

Renaming the world requires coordinated changes in 3+ places. Low value to fix unless a rename
is planned.

## Accepted / Won't Fix

These are known but intentionally not being addressed.

| Issue | File | Reason |
|-------|------|--------|
| `vrising_diagnostic.sh` uses `wine` not `wine64` | `scripts/tools/vrising/vrising_diagnostic.sh` | Works as intended per extensive testing |
| `idle_check.sh` uses GNU `date -d` (fails on macOS) | `scripts/services/idle_check/src/idle_check.sh:44` | Production is Linux; local dev never runs idle_check |
| `bfg_cleanup.sh` requires bash 4+ and uses BSD `stat` | `scripts/tools/clean_git/bfg_cleanup.sh:52,81` | macOS-only local tool; works fine there |
| `tmp.sh` orphaned in both game service dirs | `scripts/services/*/src/tmp.sh` | Saved intentionally as a reference; was removed due to complexity |

## Fixed

All of the following have been resolved and committed:

| # | Issue |
|---|-------|
| 1 | `make admin-local` broken — wrong `ADMIN_DIR` and nginx config paths |
| 2 | Admin panel log dropdown "vristing" typos (always returned 404) |
| 3 | `mcrcon_cmd()` / `get_server_password()` dead code removed |
| 4 | `/directory` page nginx log links used slashes instead of underscores |
| 5 | `refresh_users.log` key mapped to nonexistent file |
| 6 | `get_admin_server_logs.sh` referenced nonexistent `admin-server.service` |
| 7 | `game-shutdown.service` `TimeoutStartSec=300` too short for VRising (~390s worst case) → bumped to 600 |
| 8 | `docs/ai_primer.md` referenced wrong script name and nginx layout |
| 9 | `bfg_cleanup.sh` hardcoded `$HOME/Desktop/Baroboys` → derived from script location |
| 10 | `packer/build.sh` no cleanup trap on failure → added `trap 'rm -rf "$BUILD_DIR"' ERR EXIT` |
| 11 | `terraform/main.tf` `ignore_changes` on startup/shutdown metadata + metadata block removed — VM lifecycle now owned by systemd `[Install]` |
| 12 | `ServeGameSettings.jsonc` filename typo + unclear purpose → renamed to `ServerGameSettings.jsonc` and moved to `VRising/` root (annotated reference doc for `ServerGameSettings.json`) |
| 13 | `ServerHostSettings.json` + `ServerGameSettings.json` force-committed into gitignored `StreamingAssets/Settings/` → moved to `VRising/*.json.in` templates; `refresh.sh` now `envsubst`s both into Settings/ at boot |
| 14 | Flask admin server ran as root → now runs as `bwinter_sc81`; sudoers drop-in grants single `systemctl restart game-shutdown.service` permission; `adm` group added for nginx log access |
| 15 | Wine 11.0 (Jan 2026) removed `wine64` binary (unified into `wine`) → updated all 4 hardcoded `/opt/wine-stable/bin/wine64` references in `apt_wine.sh`, `src/setup.sh`, `vrising/startup.sh` |
| 16 | Xvfb race condition: `systemctl start xvfb-startup.service` (Type=simple) returned before display socket was ready; wineboot raced and failed with `start_rpcss Failed` → `boot event wait timed out` → `wine: could not load kernel32.dll, status c0000135` → build failure. Fixed via `ExecStartPost=` readiness poll in `xvfb-startup.service` |
| 17 | `review_and_cleanup.sh`: hung Packer instances (RUNNING, name~packer-) not caught — TERMINATED filter missed them. Fixed by adding dedicated section. Also fixed `gsutil ls "${bucket}**"` (invalid glob) → `gsutil ls "${bucket}"` |
